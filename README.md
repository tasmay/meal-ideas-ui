# Meal Ideas

This project was started before ChatGPT could answer all your questions!

Meal Ideas was created as a recipe search website that could help answer the dreaded question that we face every single day, that is, what to cook today? It is essentially a curated collection of recipes from my favorite creators around the world. The UI allows you to search recipes based on meal, cuisine, ingredients that you might have in your fridge, cooking time and other features.

Meal Ideas is still under construction so you might experience certain issues and some features might be missing.
